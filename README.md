# Reservoir-Levels

## Overview
A website that displays UK (or England & Wales only?) reservoir levels to the public. it will draw info from different water companies, normalise the data, and display current information. 

The webpage is developed in Python and hosted in GitHub Pages. The page will be rebuilt once per week after the MySQL database has been updated (an API, therefore, is not necessary).

## Objectives
The webpage should answer the following questions:

1) How full are UK reservoirs right now?
2) Is the current situation improving or worsening?
3) How does each region compare / differ?
4) Is this normal for this time of year?
5) What regions are in a period of drought?
